## Image Classification <a name="ImageClassification"/>

Pretrained image classification networks have already learned to extract powerful and informative features from natural images. Use them as a starting point to learn a new task using transfer learning. 

Inputs are RGB images, the output is the predicted label and score:

These networks have been trained on more than a million images and can classify images into 1000 object categories.

**Tips for selecting a model**

Pretrained networks have different characteristics that matter when choosing a network to apply to your problem. The most important characteristics are network accuracy, speed, and size. Choosing a network is generally a tradeoff between these characteristics. The following figure highlights these tradeoffs:

## Instance Segmentation <a name="InstanceSegmentation"/>

Instance segmentation is an enhanced type of object detection that generates a segmentation map for each detected instance of an object. Instance segmentation treats individual objects as distinct entities, regardless of the class of the objects. In contrast, semantic segmentation considers all objects of the same class as belonging to a single entity.

Inputs are RGB images, outputs are pixel classifications (semantic maps), bounding boxes and classification labels.

## Lidar <a name="PointCloud"/>

Point cloud data is acquired by a variety of sensors, such as lidar, radar, and depth cameras. Training robust classifiers with point cloud data is challenging because of the sparsity of data per object, object occlusions, and sensor noise. Deep learning techniques have been shown to address many of these challenges by learning robust feature representations directly from point cloud data. 

Inputs are Lidar Point Clouds converted to five-channels, outputs are segmentation, classification or object detection results overlayed on point clouds.

## Robotics <a name="RoboticsPlan"/>

Manipulator motion planning is a technique used to plan a trajectory for a robotic arm from a start position to a goal position in an obstacle environment.
  
Pretrained deep learning models have learned to plan such trajectories  for repetitive tasks such as picking and placing of objects, leading to speed ups over traditional algorithms.

Inputs are start configuration, goal configuration and obstacle environment encoding for the robot, outputs are intermediate trajectory guesses.

Motion Planning Networks (MPNet) is a deep-learning-based approach for finding optimal paths between a start point and goal point in motion planning problems.MPNet uses prior knowledge to find optimal states for motion planning.

Pre-trained deep learning models have learned to state space sampling or path planning.
